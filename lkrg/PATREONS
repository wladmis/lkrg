Dear All,

First of all, we would like to thank every Patreon supporter of the project!
Your support provided extra incentive and motivation to continue development
of LKRG.  For various reasons, I've decided to close my Patreon account, but
I will continue to develop LKRG.

Here are some of our heroes:

 - Shawn C [a.k.a "citypw"]
 - Lionel Debroux
 - Jeremy Brown
 - Robert Swiecki

Not everyone wanted to be listed but we know who you are and we are thankful.

Thank you once again for your support!

Best regards,
Adam 'pi3' Zabrocki
